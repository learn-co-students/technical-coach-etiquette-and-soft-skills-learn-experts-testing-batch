# Etiquette and Soft Skills

Below are strategies and a checklist of things you should do when working with a student. 

## Greet the Student. Be a Person.

When students are asking questions, they’ve usually spent some time trying to solve the lab or work through the reading. They might be frustrated or ready to give up or are just tired from banging their head against the wall. 

As a Technical Coach, your first task before you dive into the question is to greet the student. It can be as simple as saying “Hi! How are you doing?” Asking a question, such as how a student’s day is going, will momentarily pull them out of their frustration and give them something else to think about. That can be enough time for them to clear their head and see the problem differently (and solve it on their own). 

In addition, you want to build a rapport and trust with the student. While chat isn’t the time to become best friends with the person you’re helping, establish that you’re a human,you’re personable and you're approachable.

## Before You Begin Addressing the Question

First, check that the student doesn’t have multiple active questions open at once. Sometimes, students will have multiple questions open by mistake. If that's the case, figure out which is the primary question and close the other duplicates.

If there are other questions that the student intentionally kept open, focus on one thing at a time. In many cases, it might be working on the previous, earlier question. Tell the student to close the existing questions. Once you’ve worked with them to solve the previous question, tell them they can open a new question after that. 

## Getting the Student to Restate the Question

Now that you’ve said your greetings, go back to the question. Because students might be frustrated or want a quick resolution to the problem, they may phrase their questions pretty vaguely. Here are some common questions you might see: 

- I’m having trouble with this lab
- I don’t know what I’m doing with this lesson
- Can someone help me with this test?

Pretty vague, right? As a coach, you want the student first to be clear about what the problem is. How can you get the student to be more specific? 

- First tell them that we’re going to break their problem down further. 
- Ask them what they expected to see? 
- Ask them what they saw instead? 
- Ask them if they can explain what they saw instead? 

At this point, then restate the question and ask the student if you got everything. This will put the onus on the student to provide you with any additional details that you or they missed. It also makes them better at articulating (and thinking about articulating) their questions. 

Technical communication is one of a developer's most important skills. One of your goals as a coach is to help students improve their technical communication. In your conversations, you want to make it clear that one of your goals is to help students better articulate their problems. That way, once they've clearly articulated the problem, they can type it into Google and actually find something useful.

From there, continue debugging. 

## Be Positive 

As a Technical Coach, you’re building community and bringing a human touch to this online learning experiment. It’s important that as your student struggles through concepts or answering questions, you reassure them and tell them that making mistakes and struggling with this content is what will ultimately make them a great developer.

Tell them that error messages are great because it gets them one step closer to the answer. Tell them that programming and the debugging process is all about breaking down the problem into manageable pieces and tackling those pieces one by one. This will take time, but that’s expected. 

You can even tell students that it’s good to do something that will clear their heads, such as taking a break, going for a walk, or even sleeping. Sometimes you’ll need to encourage students and tell them that they’re on the right track. Use exclamation marks and emojis (note on emojis, you can call them up between :, so `:+1:` is :+1:, `:100:` is the :100: percent emoji). Don’t let a student’s frustrations make you frustrated. Instead be positive, be empathetic, and be kind. 

Learning new skills is difficult. If students don't get a little frustrated along the way, chances are they aren't learning much. Make sure to reassure students that frustration is part of the process, not an indicator of poor performance. The important thing is that they learn how to push through the frustration until they find a solution.
